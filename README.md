This is a package that uses the [flash_card](https://pub.dev/packages/flash_card/install) as foundation and adds additional functionality to it. 
I make this package, because the original author didnt made a new version in over 17 months so I assumed its no longer maintained. 

## Features

- change the appereance of the flashcard
- change the animation/duration.

## Getting started

check how to install [here](https://pub.dev/packages/customizable_flashcard/install)

## Usage

TODO: Include short and useful examples for package users. Add longer examples
to `/example` folder.

```dart
const like = 'sample';
```

## Additional information

TODO: Tell users more about the package: where to find more information, how to
contribute to the package, how to file issues, what response they can expect
from the package authors, and more.
